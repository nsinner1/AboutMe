        <p>
            Natalie is from the greater Seattle area. She has always had a passion for cars. She attended NASCAR Technical Institute in Charlotte, North Carolina 
            where she learned to not only work on everyday vehicles but also Stock Cars. After graduating, she was hired on to an ARCA team for 2 seasons. After funding
            ran out, she needed to switch courses. She attented University of North Carolina at Charlotte to learn Mechanical Engineering. She later found out that the 
            school and the program was just not a fit. After contemplainting life, she decided to move back home after living in North Carolina for 5 years. She and her
            mom drove the 3,000 miles over 4 days in a VERY packed Mini Cooper. After settling in, Natalie got a job with Mercedes-Benz of Bellevue. After 2 years, she was
            recurretted to Tesla. She has worked there for 2 and a half years. Currently Natalie is attending Code Fellows to help develope her new found interest of
